# Petroleum-Operation-Analysis
Data analysis of petroleum operations to identify oil and gas production, export rates as well as cost.

## Objectives
- Understand operational trends across different Countries over Time.
- Identify Countries that produce more oil and more gas.
- Identify Countries that export more oil and more gas.
- Identify High Populated Countries.
- Understand the Relationship between Prodution, Price, Export, and Popuation.
- Understand the Relationship between Gas Prices and Gas Production.
- Understand the Relationship between Oil Prices and Oil Production.

## Tools Used
- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Google Colab

## Key Findings
- Oil production increased steadily over the period of 1940 to 1980 before there was a little drop in producton. Between the period of 1980 t0 2014 there were increases and drops but the overall chat showed an uptrend.
- Gas production stayed at 0 for a while i.e around 1933 to around 1950 before there was an increase in production. This showed that there was oil production in most countries before gas production began.
- In the Year 2010 the top 10 Oil producing countries were; Russia, Saudi Arabia, US, Iran, China, Canada, Mexico, Nigeria, UAE, and Iraq.
- In the same Year i.e 2010, the top 10 Gas Producing Countries were: US, Russia, Iran, Algeria, Canada, Norway, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Indonesia, and China.
